## Introduction

Blinking an LED üí° using an Arduino is the ‚ÄúHello World‚Äù of electronics.
There are many ways to blink an LED using Arduino - [5 Ways to Blink an LED with Arduino](https://blog.wokwi.com/5-ways-to-blink-an-led-with-arduino/) describes at least 5 ways of blinking an LED.

Let's take a look at a basic example: üëá

```arduino
void setup() {
  /* gac: LED_BUILTIN maps to Arduino Uno pin 13 */
  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  /* gac: Turns the LED on */
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);
  delay(1000);
  /* gac: Turns the LED off */
  digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
  delay(1000);
}
```

The code shown above will blink an LED that is connected to Arduino pin 13. But often we
need to drive more than one LED.

For example, if we are driving three LEDs for a traffic light üö• project, it is simple
and straightforward to use three Arduino port pins. But what happens if we want to use
a large number of LEDS, such as a 5x5 LED matrix?

Arduino only has 20 GPIO pins that we can use, so using one pin per LED won't do the
trick for us. That's a shame, because a 5x5 LED matrix can display numbers, symbols
and letters and could be a great addition to our next Arduino project.

Fortunately, there are other, more pin-efficient ways to connect LEDs to Arduino.
Charlieplexing is one of the less-known methods to solve this problem: it enables
controlling many LEDs with just a few Arduino pins!

You are going to learn how it works. By the end of this article, you will have a
clear understanding of how Charlieplexing works, as well as how to code and wire
the hardware with full confidence üòé.

## LED There be Light üí°

A standard LED has two connections: Anode (+) and Cathode (-). You can make it
emit light by applying positive voltage to the LED's Anode, and negative voltage
to the Cathode.

The amount voltage you need varies between LED of different colors and types,
and is called "forward voltage". For standard 5MM red LEDs, the forward voltage
will be between 1.6 volts to 2 volts.

The LEDs also have a certain current limit (usually around 20mA). Hence, you should
use a resistor to make sure only the desired amount of current flows through the
LED (or else, it may suffer and die!).

## Charlieplexing Makes it Possible?

With Charlieplexing, we can drive up to 6 LEDs using just three pins. How does that
work? In short, we're taking advantage of a limitation of the human eye: when
multiple LEDs are sequentially lit one after the other rapidly, it will appear as
all of them are lit at the same time.

This is called "[Persistence of Vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Persistence_of_vision)"
(PoV in short).

Here are some popular examples of what you can create using this technique
(and Charlieplexing):

1. Your own matrix display driver
2. Rolling display board
3. Clock with 60 LEDs around the clock to tell the hour, minute and second hands
4. Chessboard which is bottom lit ‚Äì 64 LEDs
5. LED Cubes ‚Äì beatiful 3D cube made out of 8x8x8 LEDs (512 in total)

## How many LEDs can you drive with a given number of pins?

Short answer: many!

For an exact number, check this table out:

| Number of Pins | How many LEDs can you drive? |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |
| 2              | 2                            |
| 3              | 6                            |
| 4              | 12                           |
| 5              | 20                           |
| 6              | 30                           |
| 7              | 42                           |
| 8              | 56                           |
| 9              | 72                           |
| **n**          | **n \* (n-1)**               |

In general, you can drive `n*(n-1)` LEDs using `n` pins. This is the number of ways
of selecting `2` items out of `n` different items. For more info about the math, take a
look at the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlieplexing#Traditional_multiplexing).

---

You are still here? Great, let's see how Charlieplexing is done in practice. We'll start
from a simple Arduino design with two-port pins and work our way up to nine-port pins!

The best way to learn is by doing. Hence, we will use [Wokwi's Online Arduino Simulator](https://wokwi.com/),
meaning you will be able to run all the examples in your browser.

Why not just build the circuit with real LEDs? Trust me, you don't want to sit for hours
checking the wiring for 72 LEDs and scratching your head, just to figure out that you
have plugged some LEDs in the wrong direction or have some loose wires.

When learning (and prototyping), I believe it's best to isolate the software from the
hardware. Thus, the simulation environment gives you a working hardware, so you can
focus on learning the concept and reduce the risk of issues.

Once you understood how Charlieplexing works and have the code running in the simulator
and doing once you want, then yes, I encourage you to go ahead and build the hardware.
This way, you can minimize frustration and maximize fun! üòÅ

As you follow the rest of the tutorial, you'll be able to run the code on Wokwi's
Arduino playground with simulated LEDs, verify the code, build confidence, and when
you are ready, also build the physical circuit with the tested-and-tried software.
Let's get going!

## Light'em Up!üèá

All our examples will follow this principle: the common goal will be to be able to
individually control each LED, turn it on for a moment, and then turn it off.
Eventually, code should cycle through all the LEDs.

### Case 1: Charlieplexing 2 LEDs with 2 Arduino pins

We'll start with the most basic example: just 2 LEDs.

The Cathode of the LED<sub>(2,3)</sub> is connected to Arduino pin 2 and Anode of the
LED is connected to Arduino pin 3.

Similarly, The Cathode of the LED<sub>(3,2)</sub> is connected to Arduino Pin 3 and
Anode of the LED is connected to Arduino Pin 2.

Here is what our code will be doing:

1. Set pin 2 as OUTPUT pin
2. Set pin 3 as OUTPUT pin
3. To turn LED(2,3) ON
   a. Drive logic LOW on pin 2
   b. Drive logic HIGH on pin 3
4. To turn LED(3,2) ON
   a. Drive logic HIGH on pin 2
   b. Drive logic LOW on pin 3
5. Repeat steps 3-4 endlessly

</figure>


**Tips**: The LEDs need to have a similar forward voltage drop so as to be able to
drive all of the LEDs with equal brightness. If you have LEDs of same color and type,
it should do the trick üòâ . Also, when building this circuit, you'll need one current
limiting resistor for each used Arduino pin.

You can have a look at the screenshot of the simulation taken from
[Wokwi Arduino playground](https://wokwi.com/playground/charlieplexing):

#### Arduino Code: Basic 2 LED control with Charlieplexing

You can have a look at the below üëá Arduino code used in the simulation. You can use
your mouse to hover over the green lines to read additional explanations.

```arduino
/**

   Copyright (C) 2019, Uri Shaked. Released under the MIT license.
*/
/* gac: SCAN DELAY is the amount of time each LED will be ON */
#define SCAN_DELAY 50

void setup() {
}

void loop() {
  /* gac: We have to configure the pins as `OUTPUT` before we can drive
     them `HIGH` or `LOW` */
  pinMode(2, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(3, OUTPUT);
  /* gac: orward bias the LED(2,3), turning it ON. */
  digitalWrite(2, LOW);
  digitalWrite(3, HIGH);

  // Keep LED on for SCAN_DELAY microseconds:
  delay(SCAN_DELAY);

  /* gac:
    Configure Arduino pins 2, 3 as `INPUT`.

    This causes the LED to turn off since both pin will be at high impedance when
    configured as input, and no current will flow through the LEDs. */
  pinMode(2, INPUT);
  pinMode(3, INPUT);

  /* gac: Turn on LED(3,2) in a similar fashion */
  pinMode(2, OUTPUT);
  pinMode(3, OUTPUT);
  digitalWrite(2, HIGH);
  digitalWrite(3, LOW);
  delay(SCAN_DELAY);
  /* gac: Set pins to `INPUT` to turn the LEDs off */
  pinMode(2, INPUT);
  pinMode(3, INPUT);
}
```

</figure>


But wait! What's the benefit of this code? You could have connected two Arduino Pins to two LEDs and drive them directly, and the code would be much simpler.

In reality, you won't be using Charlieplexing in you just need to drive 2 LEDs. It doesn't make sense.
But I included this example to explain the basic logic behind Charlieplexing. Let's see how we can generalize this code so that it works for any number of pins:

#### Code Summary: Generalizing Charlieplexing!

We looked at 2 specific examples above:

- To turn on LED(2,3), we set pin 2 LOW and pin 3 HIGH
- To turn on LED(3,2), we set pin 3 LOW and pin 2 HIGH

Now, let's look at the generalized version of how we can control Charlieplexed LEDs:

1. Set all pins to `INPUT`.
2. Turning on LED(x,y):
   - Configure pins x and y as `OUTPUT`.
   - Drive pin x `LOW` and pin y `HIGH`.
3. Turning off LED(x,y): configure pins x and y as `INPUT`.

TODO In the previous code example, we made the TODO

As the number of LEDs is only two, you were able to address them individually. The code is very simple and easy to understand but not modular.
You cannot expand the code easily for three pins (to drive 6 LEDs using charlieplexing), for example. Hence we put some logic so that the same goal is achieved but with a different code.

You can find the modified code and simulation output below üëá

```
/**

   Copyright (C) 2019, Uri Shaked. Released under the MIT license.
*/

#define SCAN_DELAY 100

/* gac: The port pins are defined as an array. In this case it will be two port pins: 2,3 */
byte LEDS[] = { 2, 3 };
/* gac: to derive the number of port pins. LED_COUNT will get a value of 2 */
const byte LED_COUNT = sizeof(LEDS);

void setup() {
}

void loop() {
  /* gac:
    Variables `i` and `j` represent port pins of the Arduino.
    In first iteration, <br />
    `i` will have value of 0 --> LEDS[i] will be 2 (first element in the array) <br />
    `j` will have value of 0 --> LEDS[j] will be 2.

    `if` condition will fail.

    In the second iteration of inner for-loop, LEDS[j] will be 3.
    The `if` condition will pass.

    Since, there are only two port pins, go through the iterations manually to see the logic by yourself.
    you can leave a comment if there is need for more clarity
  */
  for (int i = 0; i < LED_COUNT; i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < LED_COUNT; j++) {
      if (i != j) { //The LED port pins are always connected to two different pins
        pinMode(LEDS[i], OUTPUT); //port 2
        pinMode(LEDS[j], OUTPUT); //port 3
        /* gac: writing port pins with the below sequence, will turn on LED(i,j)
          In first iteration, the LED(2,3) will be turned on.
          In the second iteration, LED(3,2) will be turned on.
        */
        digitalWrite(LEDS[i], LOW);
        digitalWrite(LEDS[j], HIGH);
        delay(SCAN_DELAY);
        /* gac: We will always take the pins to high impedance state before driving the next pins */
        pinMode(LEDS[i], INPUT);
        pinMode(LEDS[j], INPUT);
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## A few thoughts about Charlieplexing
1.  Charlieplexing is best suited where there is a need to drive only a few LEDs at a time
2.  The brightness of the LED would go down or become uneven when we are driving many LEDs at the same time
3.  If the leakage current of the MCU is high, the LEDs might still be lit (poorly, but visible in the dark) when the pins are configured as input.
4.  Debugging the hardware and wiring gets clumsy as pins are more
5.  Coding is easier with external multiplexers or shift registers than this technique
